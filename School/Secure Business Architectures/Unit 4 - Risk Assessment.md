## Intro

- Tier 1: Organisational
- Tier 2: Mission/business process level
- Tier 3: Information System level

Tier 1 and 2 are systemic information security related risks, associated with organizational governance, enterprise architecture, etc.

Tier 3 involves security categorization; security control selection; security control monitoring

---

There are no specific requirements with regard to:
- Formality, rigor, level of detail, etc.
- Methodologies, tools, etc.

The purpose of risk assessment is to inform decision makers and support risk responses by identifying:
- relevant threats to organizations
- Vulnerabilities, both internal and external
- Impact to organizations that may occur given the potential for threats exploiting vulnerabilities
- Likelihood that harm will occur

1. Framing risk – describing the environment in which risk-based decisions are made
2. Assessing risk
3. Responding to risk – developing and evaluating alternative courses of action, etc.
4. Monitoring risk – determine the ongoing effectiveness of risk responses; identify risk impacting changes; …

## The Fundamentals

## Key Risk Management Concepts

- **Risk**: A measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential circumstance or event.
    
- **Risk Assessment**: The process of identifying, estimating, and prioritizing information security risks.
    
- **Threat**: Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations and assets.
    
- **Threat Source**: Characterized as:
    
    1. The **intent and method** targeted at the exploitation of a vulnerability.
        
    2. A **situation** that may accidentally exploit a vulnerability.
        
- **Threat Events**: For cyber or physical attacks, these are characterized by the **Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)** employed by adversaries.
    
- **Threat Scenarios**: Developed and analyzed when threat events are identified with great specificity.
    
- **Threat Shifting**: The response of adversaries to perceived safeguards and/or countermeasures.
    
- **Vulnerability**: A weakness in an information system, security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited by a threat source.
    
- **Predisposing Condition**: A condition within an organization or mission which affects the likelihood that threat events, once initiated, result in adverse impacts.
    
- **Likelihood of Occurrence**: A weighted risk factor based on the probability that a given threat is capable of exploiting a given vulnerability.
    
    - **Adversarial Threats**: Based on adversary _intent_, _capability_, and _targeting_.
        
    - **Non-Adversarial Threats**: Estimated using historical evidence, empirical data, or other factors.
        
- **Level of Impact**: The magnitude of harm that can be expected to result from the consequences of a threat event.
    
- **Risk Aggregation**: The process of rolling up several discrete or lower-level risks into a more general or higher-level risk.
    
- **Uncertainty**: A factor inherent in the evaluation of all risk.

| **Term**          | **Core Focus**                           |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Threat**        | The external/internal "actor" or "event" |
| **Vulnerability** | The internal "weakness"                  |
| **Likelihood**    | Probability of exploitation              |
| **Impact**        | Magnitude of harm/consequences           |

1. Perceived through science
2. Virtual risk
3. Perceived directly
